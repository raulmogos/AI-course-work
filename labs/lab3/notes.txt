An EA contains four overall steps:
    initialization
    selection
    genetic operators
    termination

-context -> problem
-initialisation -> create (within the constraints of the problem) a population
                   (a random number of possible solutions, oftentimes called members/individuals)
-selection -> Once a population is created, members of the population must now be evaluated
              according to a fitness function. A fitness function is a function that takes in
              the characteristics of a member, and outputs a numerical representation of how viable
              of a solution it is. Creating the fitness function can often be very difficult, and it is
              important to find a good function that accurately represents the data; it is very problem-specific.
