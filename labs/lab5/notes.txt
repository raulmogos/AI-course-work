ACO - ant colony optimisation

- ants produce pheromones
- they use pheromone to communicate between each other
  (similar to water in our analogy)
- ants are more LIKELY to chose a path with HIGHER pheromone -> decision made based on probability

ex:
    shortest path i a graph:
    - cost matrix (distance)
    - pheromone matrix
